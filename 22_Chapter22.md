# Train the RandomForest model using the training data (X_train, y_train)
rclf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Use the trained model to predict labels for the test data (X_test)
rpredictions = rclf.predict(X_test)
```

In this cryptic forest, Alice and Ada learnt to harness multiple decision trees operating in unison to form a RandomForestClassifier. This powerful model improved prediction accuracy, demonstrating the brilliance of ensemble techniques.

## K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier

Lastly, the K-Nearest Neighbors model brewed an algorithmic concoction for Alice and Ada to delve into classification tasks even further.

kclf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Use the trained model to predict labels for the test data (X_test)
kpredictions = kclf.predict(X_test)
```

In this final foray, Alice and Ada brewed a K-Nearest Neighbors model, enriching it with the nectar of training data, then employing it to divine predictions from test data, enriching their knowledge of Scikit-learn's ever-fascinating capabilities.
