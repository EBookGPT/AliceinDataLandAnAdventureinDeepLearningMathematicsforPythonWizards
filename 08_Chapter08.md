## The Secret Formula: What is Gradient Descent?

As Alice wanders deeper into DataLand, she encounters a majestic library 📚 holding the wisdom of countless mathematicians and computer scientists. In particular, she discovers a book detailing the secrets of gradient descent, the magical optimization tool!

Gradient descent is truly a wondrous algorithm: it iteratively updates the parameters (or weights) of a model, with the noble goal of minimizing a given objective function (also known as the cost or loss function). In our adventure, we will consider gradient descent in the realms of machine learning and deep learning, where we seek the optimal weights for our delightfully intricate models.

The secret formula is presented here in all its glory:

`θ_{i+1} = θ_i - η*(∇J(θ_i))`

In this incantation, `θ` represents the model parameters, `η` is the learning rate (a vital hyperparameter), and `∇J(θ)` is the gradient of the cost function `J` with respect to the parameters `θ`. 

But worry not, dear Python wizards, for each spellbinding concept will be unveiled step by step in the upcoming sections!

## Python Wisdom: Modeling Gradient Descent

Being a Python wizard isn't just about knowing how to code like a sorcerer; it's also about understanding the foundational stones that underlie the spells! 🪄

Consider this Python snippet: a simple and elegant implementation of the gradient descent technique:

```python
import numpy as np

def gradient_descent(J, dJ, theta_init, eta=0.01, max_iter=1000):
    theta = theta_init
    theta_history = [theta]
    cost_history = [J(theta)]

    for _ in range(max_iter):
        gradient = dJ(theta)
        theta = theta - eta * gradient
        theta_history.append(theta)
        cost_history.append(J(theta))

    return theta, np.array(theta_history), np.array(cost_history)
```

In this wondrous code, `J` is a function corresponding to the cost function and `dJ` is its gradient! With our trusty sidekick Numpy by our side, we provide the gradient descent function some starting values of `θ`, a learning rate `η`, and maximum number of iterations `max_iter`. Could our world get any more bewitching?

And so, Alice's adventure continues in this magical land, further revealing the untold secrets of gradient descent and exploring its many fascinating versions.

Join Alice as she gulps down the rest of the gradient descent potion, continuing her thrilling journey into the depths of DataLand, and learning about **Batch Gradient Descent**, **Mini-Batch Gradient Descent**, and **Stochastic Gradient Descent**. Will Alice find the optimal path on which to travel? Only time and gradients will tell! 🧪

## Adventures on Hills of Knowledge: Batch, Mini-Batch & Stochastic Gradient Descent ⛰️

Alice, now an explorer of the gradient descent realm, sets out to conquer three bewitching realms, each representing a unique form of this magical algorithm:

1. **Batch Gradient Descent (The Kingdom of Complete Wisdom)**: In this kingdom, Alice performs a single step down the gradient, considering *all* training samples in her descent. Each step is as prudent and calculated as the Cheshire Cat's grin. However, computing the complete wisdom takes its toll, making it an impractical choice for Alice when traversing vast and intricate lands.

```python
for i in range(num_epochs):
    dw, db = compute_gradients(X, y, w, b)
    w = w - eta * dw
    b = b - eta * db
```

2. **Stochastic Gradient Descent (The Wonderland of Randomness)**: In stark contrast to the first kingdom, Alice takes individual steps, each guided by just *one* training sample in this whimsical realm. Thus, she descends furiously like the Mad Hatter's dancing! While more chaotic and noisy, she traverses the valleys faster, making it a tantalizing choice for large enchanted forests.

```python
for i in range(num_epochs):
    for x_i, y_i in zip(X, y):
        dw, db = compute_gradients(x_i, y_i, w, b)
        w = w - eta * dw
        b = b - eta * db
```

3. **Mini-Batch Gradient Descent (The Queendom of Balanced Grace)**: The final realm synthesizes the virtues of its siblings. By considering a *mini-batch* of training samples, Alice strikes a balance between the strategies of the other kingdoms, making it an optimal choice for many Python wizards-in-training as they pursue the mastery of gradient descent.

```python
for i in range(num_epochs):
    for X_batch, y_batch in batch_loader(X, y, batch_size):
        dw, db = compute_gradients(X_batch, y_batch, w, b)
        w = w - eta * dw
        b = b - eta * db
```

---

As Alice conquers each enthralling realm of gradient descent, she gains the power to find local minima and optimize her knowledge gracefully, dancing through the multidimensional hills of DataLand.

With the wisdom bestowed upon her by the Descent Potion, Alice boldly ventures forth to new frontiers, eagerly awaiting the challenges that the enchanted realm of DataLand holds.

Will Alice continue to master the secrets of DataLand's algorithms while traversing unfamiliar terrain? Stay tuned for the next fantastical adventure, as we journey with Alice and uncover even more beguiling spells and wondrous potions! 🌌

# Code Explanations: Conquering Gradient Descent with Python 🐍

In the whimsical adventure of Alice through the realms of gradient descent, she encounters three captivating variants: batch, stochastic, and mini-batch gradient descent. The code samples scattered amidst the story illustrate these methods, giving aspiring Python wizards a deep learning spellbook to memorize!

Let's dissect the code snippets, unraveling the pythonic enchantments cast by Alice on her journey:

## 1. Batch Gradient Descent 🌍

In the realm of batch gradient descent, Alice processes _all_ training samples before updating the parameters. Here's how the spell works:

```python
for i in range(num_epochs):
    dw, db = compute_gradients(X, y, w, b)
    w = w - eta * dw
    b = b - eta * db
```

* `num_epochs`: Represents the number of complete passes through the dataset.
* `compute_gradients(X, y, w, b)`: A placeholder function that represents the computation of gradients.
* `X, y`: Complete dataset inputs and outputs supplied to the `compute_gradients` function.
* `w, b`: Represents the parameters of the enigma Alice must optimize in her quest.
* `eta`: The learning rate, a tunable hyperparameter adjusting the step sizes.

In this enchantment, gradients are computed on the _entire_ dataset (`X`, `y`) and employed to update `w` and `b`. The spell repeats for `num_epochs` iterations.

## 2. Stochastic Gradient Descent 🎲

Alice then ventures through the land of random wonders, utilizing stochastic gradient descent, where _one_ training sample guides each parameter update. Here's the code snippet:

```python
for i in range(num_epochs):
    for x_i, y_i in zip(X, y):
        dw, db = compute_gradients(x_i, y_i, w, b)
        w = w - eta * dw
        b = b - eta * db
```

* `for x_i, y_i in zip(X,y)`: A magical loop that iterates over individual samples `(x_i, y_i)` from the dataset.
* `compute_gradients(x_i, y_i, w, b)`: The `compute_gradients` function now takes a single input-output pair to calculate the gradients.

In this version of the spell, Alice iteratively updates parameters using a single training data pair `(x_i, y_i)` drawn randomly from the dataset.

## 3. Mini-Batch Gradient Descent ⚖️

Alice's final challenge lies in the land of balanced wisdom, where she learns about mini-batch gradient descent, a harmonious blend of batch and stochastic methods. Here's a look at the code:

```python
for i in range(num_epochs):
    for X_batch, y_batch in batch_loader(X, y, batch_size):
        dw, db = compute_gradients(X_batch, y_batch, w, b)
        w = w - eta * dw
        b = b - eta * db
```

* `batch_loader(X, y, batch_size)`: A mysterious function that conjures mini-batches of training data of size `batch_size` from the dataset.
* `for X_batch, y_batch in batch_loader(X, y, batch_size)`: A magical loop that iterates over the mini-batches `(X_batch, y_batch)`.

In this final incantation, Alice casts her love for balance, using an intermediate number of training samples in each iteration to fine-tune her understanding, striking the perfect harmony between her previous spells.
