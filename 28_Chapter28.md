# Chapter 28: The White Rabbit's Interactive Guide: Recommender Systems and Collaborative Filtering - The Adventure

_Alice and the White Rabbit stood before a giant, intricate-looking mechanism. The gears churned, the machine whirred, and colorful lights flickered, reflecting off its shiny exterior._

> "This, my dear Alice, is the illustrious Recommendation Engine!" the White Rabbit announced, unable to contain his excitement.

"Now, let's dive into the world of Recommender Systems, starting with **Matrix Factorization**," he continued.

## Matrix Factorization

_"Imagine a land where users, items, and their interactions are represented in matrices. We seek to uncover the relationships hidden within these matrices by decomposing them into smaller, more tractable components,"_ the White Rabbit said, gesturing with his pocket watch.

Alice looked around and found herself standing in a place filled with matrices.

```python
import numpy as np

# Sample interaction matrix
interaction_matrix = np.array([[2, 0, 0, 1],
                               [0, 0, 3, 0],
                               [0, 3, 1, 1],
                               [1, 0, 0, 2]])
```

>"Now, let's factorize this interaction_matrix using the following," the White Rabbit instructed.

```python
U, S, Vt = np.linalg.svd(interaction_matrix)
print("U:", U)
print("S:", S)
print("Vt:", Vt)
```

The lights danced around them, revealing hidden patterns within the matrices.

## User-based and Item-based Collaborative Filtering

_"In our quest to make recommendations, we will encounter two wondrous strategies. One, **User-based Collaborative Filtering**, where we learn from the preferences of users similar to you; and two, **Item-based Collaborative Filtering**, where we recommend items similar to those you've liked before,"_ the White Rabbit explained.

```python
def user_cosine_similarity(matrix, user1, user2):
    dot_product = np.dot(matrix[user1], matrix[user2])
    norm_product = np.linalg.norm(matrix[user1]) * np.linalg.norm(matrix[user2])
    return dot_product / norm_product

def item_cosine_similarity(matrix, item1, item2):
    dot_product = np.dot(matrix[:, item1], matrix[:, item2])
    norm_product = np.linalg.norm(matrix[:, item1]) * np.linalg.norm(matrix[:, item2])
    return dot_product / norm_product
```

Amidst the swirling maelstrom, Alice saw myriad connections form and dissolve, illustrating the similarities between users and items.

## Singular Value Decomposition

_A gust of wind swept through, revealing the elegant method of **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**._

_"This decomposition allows you to extract salient features within matrices, which can be used to make better recommendations,"_ the White Rabbit shared.

```python
import scipy.sparse.linalg as sp

k = 2
U_, S_, Vt_ = sp.svds(interaction_matrix, k)
S_ = np.diag(S_)

print("U_:", U_)
print("S_:", S_)
print("Vt_:", Vt_)
```

By harnessing the power of SVD, Alice grew more confident in her recommendations, as those swirling lights began to align in perfect harmony.

## Implementing a Recommender System using Python

_The White Rabbit handed Alice a shimmering key._

_"Dear Alice, use this key to embrace the power of Python and construct a magnificent Recommender System."_ 

Alice took a deep breath, and with the key, she unlocked the potential within herself, crafting the Recommender System.

```python
def predict_rating(U, S, Vt, user, item):
    return np.dot(U[user], np.dot(S, Vt[:, item]))

def recommend_items(user, n_recommendations):
    predictions = [predict_rating(U_, S_, Vt_, user, item) for item in range(interaction_matrix.shape[1])]
    
    return np.argsort(predictions)[::-1][:n_recommendations]

# Let's recommend items for user 0
recommended_items = recommend_items(0, 3)
print("Recommended items for user 0:", recommended_items)
```

With the Recommender System in hand, Alice witnessed the creation of wondrous pathways, displaying countless enchanting items tailored for each user.

_Thus, Alice had found her way in this adventure, unlocking the mysteries of Recommender Systems and Collaborative Filtering, guided by her trusty Python and the ever-present White Rabbit._

The adventure in DataLand continues, as new doors open and countless wonders awaitâ€¦
# Explaining the Code: A Journey Through Alice's Recommender System Adventure

Throughout Alice's adventure in Chapter 28, various snippets of Python code helped her unravel the mysteries of Recommender Systems and Collaborative Filtering. Let us take a closer look at each part of the code and delve deeper into their magic.

## Interaction Matrix

The journey begins with the creation of an interaction matrix. This matrix represents the preferences of users towards certain items in DataLand.

```python
interaction_matrix = np.array([[2, 0, 0, 1],
                               [0, 0, 3, 0],
                               [0, 3, 1, 1],
                               [1, 0, 0, 2]])
```

In this matrix, the rows represent the users, the columns represent the items, and the elements represent how much a user likes a particular item. A zero value indicates no interaction between the user and the item.

## Matrix Decomposition using SVD

To discover the underlying patterns within the matrix, Alice uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to break it into three matrices (U, S, and Vt).

```python
U, S, Vt = np.linalg.svd(interaction_matrix)
```

These matrices hold valuable information about the users, items, and their relationships, which can be harnessed to make accurate recommendations.

## Cosine Similarity Functions

To calculate the similarity between users and items, Alice defines two cosine similarity functions: `user_cosine_similarity` and `item_cosine_similarity`.

```python
def user_cosine_similarity(matrix, user1, user2):
    ...
def item_cosine_similarity(matrix, item1, item2):
    ...
```

These functions measure the angles between respective vectors found in users' preferences (user-based) and items' traits (item-based), and return values between -1 and 1. A value close to 1 indicates high similarity, while a value close to -1 indicates dissimilarity.

## Reducing Dimensions with Truncated SVD

To optimize the recommendation process, Alice employs Truncated SVD to reduce the dimensions of the original interaction matrix.

```python
k = 2
U_, S_, Vt_ = sp.svds(interaction_matrix, k)
S_ = np.diag(S_)
```

This approximation simplifies the matrix decomposition while preserving the most important components that contribute to users' preferences.

## Predicting User-item Ratings

To predict a user's rating for an item, Alice defines the `predict_rating` function. This function computes the dot product of the user factors (U), singular values (S), and the item factors (Vt).

```python
def predict_rating(U, S, Vt, user, item):
    return np.dot(U[user], np.dot(S, Vt[:, item]))
```

The result of this function is an estimation of the rating the user would give to the item.

## Recommending Items

Finally, Alice creates a `recommend_items` function, which outputs the top N recommended items for a user based on their predicted ratings.

```python
def recommend_items(user, n_recommendations):
    ...
```

This function predicts ratings for all items not rated by the user and returns the items with the highest predicted ratings.

By breaking down Alice's code, we can follow her journey as she explores the world of Recommender Systems and Collaborative Filtering, making sense of the magical concepts and weaving them into practical Python code.
