# Chapter 6: Speak in Data Whispers: Introduction to Data Preprocessing

*_Featuring special guest star Ada Lovelace_*

Once upon a neuron dream, Alice arrived under a mushroom tree, with whispers where data thrives, the beauty of preprocessed lives. Welcome dear Python wizards, to a realm that seemed so bizarre, where Alice's magical journey in DataLand takes her far.

In this chapter, we shall find Alice embarking on a learning quest. Ada Lovelace joins her side, as they together will do their best. Ada - a pioneer of her time, encourages Alice to refine, so they both assemble their Python wands, to cast spells on data by design.

"Data whispers," stated Ada Lovelace with glee. "Let's embark on this journey to see what we'll be. Numbers and treasures, in a vast tangled ocean. We will find patterns, all covered in motion."

Today, our Python wizards, we shall study Data Preprocessing, a crucial step in the mathematical dance of Deep Learning. Fear not, for our adventuresome Alice will guide you through this mysterious land where data must be tamed to meet the demands of our neural networks.

Join Alice and Ada on this adventure that twists and turns, as they learn and conquer, the art of data's returns.

## Whispers of raw data

Raw data surrounds us, coming in various forms. To feed this data to our networks, we must transform and perform.

In the enchanting forest, Alice and Ada were met with a peculiar sight. A cat composed of numbers, floating letters and text bytes.

```
{
"name": "CheshireCat",
"colors": ["Pink", "Purple"],
"size": "15cm",
"weight": "1 2 . 3 4 KG",
"age": null,
"smile_strength": ":)"
}
```

"A curious creature," Alice did say. "We must decode it before we play."

Alice and Ada knew they must preprocess the cat's data, to keep their magical algorithms happily fed, without erratum.

## The spell of missing data & feature scaling

Alice and Ada beheld a broken data record, with a cat so young, its age unknown. They summoned their Python powers, to either fill in or remove what was not shown.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer

data = pd.DataFrame({'age': [None, 2, 3], 'size': [1, 2, 3]})
imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='mean')
data_imputed = imputer.fit_transform(data)
```

The Cheshire Cat's true age surfaced, thanks to Alice and Ada's magic trick. The missing value transformed; by average, it was picked.

Next, they encountered feature scaling, dragging their data behind. It needed some taming, to keep the networks aligned.

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler, StandardScaler

scaler_mm = MinMaxScaler()
scaler_std = StandardScaler()

minmax_scaled = scaler_mm.fit_transform(data_imputed)
standard_scaled = scaler_std.fit_transform(data_imputed)
```

Scaling and encoding, Alice and Ada's journey continues, in pursuit of knowledge, data mysteries, and hidden math truths.

Alice and Ada stride further into the whispers of DataLand, their spirits high and their heads full of mathematical commands. They've unlocked the preprocessed secret, where data stories unfold. Python wizards, stay with them, for more adventures to be told.
# Chapter 6: Speak in Data Whispers: An Apprenticeship in Data Preprocessing

*_Continuing the adventures of Alice and special guest star Ada Lovelace_*

As Alice and Ada Lovelace wandered the forest, the trees began to talk, rustling their leaves and sharing wisdom with the ground beneath their roots. Suddenly, the forest opened up to a grand workshop, as a tree bellowed, *"Welcome Python wizards! You seek to learn data whispers, to preprocess data with your fingertips. Sit, uncover the secrets that our magical DataLand holds, and bring order to chaos with your Python code!"*

## The Lesson Begins

Ada Lovelace shared her knowledge, "Young Alice, preprocessing is key, as from noisy data our models must be freed."

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
```

"To begin," Ada spoke, "let's create a table with some missing pieces. Your task, to fill the voids, so the power of data increases."

```python
data = pd.DataFrame({"age": [None, 5, 6, 9], "size": [1, None, 2, None]})
print(data)
```

Alice cast the spell, and what she saw were holes, in numerical inklings, crying out for filling roles.

"_Let's continue with our journey_", Ada taught. "_To fill the gaps, a method we'll use, and within moments, we'll see the result ensue._"

```python
imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='mean')
data_imputed = imputer.fit_transform(data)
```

The table now gleamed with the missing information filled; Alice's heart swelled with pride, as her skills were further distilled.

## Encoding Categorical Variables

Ada Lovelace, sensing Alice's burgeoning talent, prepared the next lesson: encoding categorical variables, where data translates into meaningful elements.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
```

"Behold, a tree of various species, tall and strong," Ada illustrated, "Yet, each tree type as merely a word is wrong."

```python
tree_data = pd.DataFrame({"species": ["Oak", "Willow", "Oak", "Birch"]})
print(tree_data)
```

Alice observed the names and acknowledged their grace, but jumped with joy, knowing numbers would take their place.

"Great job, Alice!", Ada cheered. "Now apply LabelEncoder, to replace words with wisdom so much truer."

```python
encoder = LabelEncoder()
tree_data["species_encoded"] = encoder.fit_transform(tree_data["species"])
print(tree_data)
```

As the names transformed into an array of digits, Alice knew her models could learn from them â€“ so exquisite!

## The Forest of Normalization

"You've come a long way," praised Ada Lovelace, "but there's more to explore. We'll enter the Forest of Normalization, a place to adjust scales, opening more doors."

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler, StandardScaler
```

Alice and Ada encountered a stream of digits, with numbers too vast and too small.

"By normalizing these numbers," Ada advised, "we can harmonize them; a fairer process, recognized."

```python
data_dimensions = pd.DataFrame({"width": [5, 25, 20, 10], "height": [10000, 20000, 15000, 25000]})
```

MinMaxScaler and StandardScaler, two tools at hand; Alice's code bewitched the data, commanding it as planned.

```python
scaler_mm = MinMaxScaler()
scaler_std = StandardScaler()

minmax_normalized = scaler_mm.fit_transform(data_dimensions)
standard_normalized = scaler_std.fit_transform(data_dimensions)
```

As the numerals shimmered and glowed, Alice saw them remodeled, giving way to a new data flow.

Triumphantly, Alice and Ada uncovered the secrets of preprocessing, enlightening her path on this mystical journey through DataLand. Undeterred by tangled structures, unknown values, or misaligned scales, these Python wizards advanced together, towards the power of deep learning tales.
# Code Explanations: Alice in DataLand's Data Preprocessing Adventure

Throughout Alice and Ada Lovelace's journey in DataLand, they encountered various aspects of data preprocessing. In this section, we shall delve deeper into the code's mysteries and take a closer look at the spells they cast to preprocess data.

## Imputing Missing Values

Alice and Ada tackled the challenge of missing values in their data. To accomplish this, they made use of the following steps:

1. **Import necessary libraries**: They imported `pandas` and the `SimpleImputer` class.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
```

2. **Create a DataFrame with missing values**: Alice and Ada generated a DataFrame containing `None` values, signifying the missing data.

```python
data = pd.DataFrame({"age": [None, 5, 6, 9], "size": [1, None, 2, None]})
```

3. **Impute missing values with the mean**: They used the `SimpleImputer` class to impute the missing values using the mean of the corresponding column.

```python
imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='mean')
data_imputed = imputer.fit_transform(data)
```

## Encoding Categorical Variables

In their quest to encode categorical variables, Alice and Ada performed the following actions:

1. **Import necessary libraries**: They imported the `LabelEncoder` class.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
```

2. **Create a DataFrame with categorical variables**: They generated a DataFrame with tree species as categorical variables.

```python
tree_data = pd.DataFrame({"species": ["Oak", "Willow", "Oak", "Birch"]})
```

3. **Encode categorical variables**: They utilized the `LabelEncoder` class to encode tree species as numerical values.

```python
encoder = LabelEncoder()
tree_data["species_encoded"] = encoder.fit_transform(tree_data["species"])
```

## Normalizing Data

In the mystical Forest of Normalization, Alice and Ada took the following steps:

1. **Import necessary libraries**: They imported the `MinMaxScaler` and `StandardScaler` classes.

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler, StandardScaler
```

2. **Create a DataFrame with differing scales**: They created a DataFrame with width and height values on different scales.

```python
data_dimensions = pd.DataFrame({"width": [5, 25, 20, 10], "height": [10000, 20000, 15000, 25000]})
```

3. **Normalize data**: Employing `MinMaxScaler` and `StandardScaler`, they effectively normalized the data.

```python
scaler_mm = MinMaxScaler()
scaler_std = StandardScaler()

minmax_normalized = scaler_mm.fit_transform(data_dimensions)
standard_normalized = scaler_std.fit_transform(data_dimensions)
```

These code snippets provided Alice and Ada with the knowledge to address various data preprocessing challenges. With their Python wands in hand, they triumphed in their quest, bridging the gap between raw data and the deep learning wonders that awaited them.
