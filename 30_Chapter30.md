    if not synonyms:
        return word
    return synonyms[0].lemmas()[0].name()

# Shuffle and swap
def text_augmentation(sentence):
    words = sentence.split()
    shuffled_sentence = ' '.join(random.sample(words, len(words)))
    augmented_words = [replace_synonyms(word) for word in words]
    return ' '.join(augmented_words)
```

The `image_augmentation` function takes the following parameters:
- `rotation`: The degree range within which the image rotation occurs
- `shear`: Shear angle in degrees
- `zoom`: Zoom range (e.g., [0.9, 1.1] for zooming in and out)

```python
def image_augmentation(rotation, shear, zoom):
    image_gen = ImageDataGenerator(
        rotation_range=rotation,
        shear_range=shear,
        zoom_range=zoom
    )
    return image_gen
```

### Flipping, Padding, and Cropping:

The `image_augmentation_flips_paddings_crop` function accepts the following parameters:
- `horizontal_flip`: Boolean for flipping the image horizontally
- `padding`: Padding range for shifting the image horizontally and vertically
- `cropping`: Cropping range for zooming

```python
def image_augmentation_flips_paddings_crop(horizontal_flip, padding, cropping):
    image_gen = ImageDataGenerator(
        horizontal_flip=horizontal_flip,
        width_shift_range=padding,
        height_shift_range=padding,
        zoom_range=cropping

```python
def replace_synonyms(word):
    synonyms = wordnet.synsets(word)
    if not synonyms:
        return word
    return synonyms[0].lemmas()[0].name()
```

The `text_augmentation` function shuffles the words in a sentence and replaces words with their synonyms:

```python
def text_augmentation(sentence):
    words = sentence.split()
    shuffled_sentence = ' '.join(random.sample(words, len(words)))
    augmented_words = [replace_synonyms(word) for word in words]
    return ' '.join(augmented_words)
```

## III. Time Series Troika: The Dance of the Temporal

In their journey, Alice and the Python Wizards gracefully waltzed through Time, performing elegant augmentations with time series data:

### Jitter, Scaling, and Smoothing:

The `time_series_augmentation` function amalgamates the following techniques to alter the time series data:
- `jitter`: Adding random noise to the data
- `scaling`: Altering the amplitude of the data by a certain factor
- `smoothing`: Applying a moving average to the data

```python
def time_series_augmentation(series, noise, scaling_factor, window):
    jittered_series = series + np.random.normal(0, noise, len(series))
    scaled_series = series * scaling_factor
    smoothed_series = np.convolve(series, np.ones((window,))/window, mode='valid')
    return jittered_series, scaled_series, smoothed_series
```

These enchanting Python spells guided Alice and her companions in their DataLand adventure, serving as the cornerstone to mastering the magical realm of Data Augmentation.
