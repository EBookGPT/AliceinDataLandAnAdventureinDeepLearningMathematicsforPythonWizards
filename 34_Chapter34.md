# Chapter 34: A Python's Ethical Dilemma: Ethics and Bias in AI

_Once upon a time in the magical world of DataLand, Alice, our curious and ambitious Python wizard, was wandering through the enchanted Forest of Computation. As she ventured further into the forest, she stumbled upon a hidden cave: The Cave of Ethical Dilemmas. Filled with intrigue, Alice decided to enter the cave to uncover its mysteries._

A curious-looking rabbit popped out of a hole and startled Alice. She recognized him as _The White Rabbit_, the well-known guide of DataLand.

```python
class WhiteRabbit:
    def __init__(self, name, role):
        self.name = name
        self.role = role

Rabbit = WhiteRabbit("The White Rabbit", "DataLand Guide")
```

"Greetings, Alice! You've entered the Cave of Ethical Dilemmas, where the walls whisper tales about Ethics and Bias in AI," said the rabbit. "In this new adventure, you'll encounter deep learning mathematics, Python code, and some of your most challenging ethical decisions yet!"

With excitement and apprehension, Alice took a deep breath and prepared for the most enlightening adventure of her journey in DataLand.

## Ethical Dilemmas In AI: Revealing The Hidden Concerns

In her first steps into the Cave of Ethical Dilemmas, Alice discovered that AI, much like the powerful spells she was accustomed to, could have unintended consequences.

The cave walls whispered the following quote:

_“With great power comes great responsibility.” Uncle Ben, Spiderman_

It turns out that many decisions made during the development of AI systems could unintentionally perpetuate and amplify inequalities found in their training data. As responsible Python wizards, our challenge is to recognize and mitigate these biases.

### Ethics and Bias in Data

Bias in machines is a reflection of the biases found in humans and our data. These biases can lead to the unintended and unfair treatment of certain groups of people.

To understand hidden biases, Alice must learn the power of the _“Butterfly Effect” theory_ from a famous mathematician, [Edward Lorenz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Norton_Lorenz).

```python
def butterfly_effect(small_change, impact):
    return (small_change * impact)

small_change = 0.1
impact_of_bias = 100

bias_amplification = butterfly_effect(small_change, impact_of_bias)
```

With this understanding, Alice must analyze the data she feeds into her models to identify and address biases.

### Addressing Bias in AI

To address biases, Alice must employ a few magical techniques to ensure fairness and ethical decision-making in her AI models:

1. Pre-processing: Clean and analyze the training data to identify and remove biases.
2. In-processing: Balance data when training the model to reduce the effects of biased data.
3. Post-processing: Evaluate the AI model to identify and rectify biased outcomes.

The journey through the world of Ethics and Bias in AI will reveal to Alice some intriguing applications and methods that she can use to build fairer and more ethical AI systems.

To begin, she will take a deep dive into the depths of this cave, where she will face ethical challenges more immense than she ever imagined. The White Rabbit will be Alice's constant companion, as she learns how to wield her Python wizardry to balance and mitigate the biases hidden within her models.

## The Cave of Ethical Dilemmas: Adventures in Bias Detection and Mitigation

_In the heart of the enchanted Cave of Ethical Dilemmas, Alice noticed the walls were adorned with various symbols and equations representing the biases hidden in AI._

### The Fairytale of Training Data

The White Rabbit beckoned Alice to approach the first wall, which depicted a magical tale of three kingdoms. Each kingdom had a dataset of citizens with attributes including age, height, weight, and education level.

Alice was tasked with creating a model that predicted the cost of healthcare for each citizen, which would ultimately inform healthcare policies in the kingdoms.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

kingdom1_data = pd.read_csv("kingdom1.csv")
kingdom2_data = pd.read_csv("kingdom2.csv")
kingdom3_data = pd.read_csv("kingdom3.csv")
```

### The Riddle of the Biased Mirror

The White Rabbit presented Alice with a riddle in the form of a magical mirror:

_“In this reflective surface, find the hidden measure of bias, and unleash your wisdom to address it.”_

Alice soon realized that the riddle referred to calculating statistics and uncovering biases within the datasets. To solve the riddle, she wrote a Python function to calculate the mean and median of each attribute for the kingdoms' citizens:

```python
def calc_mean_median(data):
    return data.mean(), data.median()

kingdom1_mean, kingdom1_median = calc_mean_median(kingdom1_data)
kingdom2_mean, kingdom2_median = calc_mean_median(kingdom2_data)
kingdom3_mean, kingdom3_median = calc_mean_median(kingdom3_data)
```

By comparing the means and medians, Alice observed discrepancies in the data that suggested the presence of biases.

### Addressing Bias: The Mystic Fables

The cave whispered three mystical fables to Alice, guiding her in addressing the biases she had found:

1. **The Tale of the Balanced Dataset**: In this tale, Alice learned to balance datasets, ensuring the data in her model represented each kingdom fairly.

```python
from sklearn.utils import resample

def balance_datasets(kingdom_data, target_number):
    return resample(kingdom_data, replace=True, n_samples=target_number, random_state=42)

balanced_kingdom1_data = balance_datasets(kingdom1_data, 1000)
balanced_kingdom2_data = balance_datasets(kingdom2_data, 1000)
balanced_kingdom3_data = balance_datasets(kingdom3_data, 1000)
```

2. **The Saga of the Fair Model**: The cave told Alice a story about creating an AI model trained with carefully preprocessed data.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

data = pd.concat([balanced_kingdom1_data, balanced_kingdom2_data, balanced_kingdom3_data])

X = data.drop("healthcare_cost", axis=1)
y = data["healthcare_cost"]

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

fair_model = LinearRegression().fit(X_train, y_train)
```

3. **The Parable of Unbiased Predictions**: The last parable inspired Alice to evaluate her model's predictions, ensuring they were fair for each kingdom's citizens.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

y_pred = fair_model.predict(X_test)

mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
```


### The Dawn of Ethical AI

Armed with her newfound knowledge, Alice applied the lessons from the mystical fables to create a more ethical AI model. Her model predicted healthcare costs fairly across the kingdoms, promoting equitable healthcare policies for all citizens.

_Embracing the magic of the Cave of Ethical Dilemmas, Alice solidified her commitment to promote fairness and address biases throughout her journey in DataLand._

**Onward to a fairer realm!**
_“Continue to weave the spells of unbiased AI, and together we shall build a fairer, more magical DataLand for all.” The White Rabbit_

_Follow Alice in her future adventures, as she conquers new challenges and strives to create a wondrous and ethical world of AI in DataLand._
## Chapter 34: Code Explanation in Alice's Ethical Dilemma

Below is a detailed explanation of the code used to tackle ethical dilemmas, biases, and fairness in Alice's AI adventure. 

### Importing and Reading the Datasets

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

kingdom1_data = pd.read_csv("kingdom1.csv")
kingdom2_data = pd.read_csv("kingdom2.csv")
kingdom3_data = pd.read_csv("kingdom3.csv")
```
In this section, Alice imports the necessary Python libraries, pandas and numpy, to read and manipulate the datasets. She then reads the CSV files containing the data for all three kingdoms using the `pd.read_csv()` method.

### Calculating Mean and Median

```python
def calc_mean_median(data):
    return data.mean(), data.median()

kingdom1_mean, kingdom1_median = calc_mean_median(kingdom1_data)
kingdom2_mean, kingdom2_median = calc_mean_median(kingdom2_data)
kingdom3_mean, kingdom3_median = calc_mean_median(kingdom3_data)
```

Alice creates a function `calc_mean_median()` that takes a dataset as an input and returns the mean and median for each attribute. She then calls this function for each kingdom's dataset, which helps her identify the presence of biases in the data.

### Balancing the Datasets

```python
from sklearn.utils import resample

def balance_datasets(kingdom_data, target_number):
    return resample(kingdom_data, replace=True, n_samples=target_number, random_state=42)

balanced_kingdom1_data = balance_datasets(kingdom1_data, 1000)
balanced_kingdom2_data = balance_datasets(kingdom2_data, 1000)
balanced_kingdom3_data = balance_datasets(kingdom3_data, 1000)
```

Alice uses the scikit-learn library's `resample()` method to balance the datasets, ensuring that each kingdom's data is represented fairly. The `balance_datasets()` function takes in a dataset and a target_number of samples, returning a resampled dataset with the desired number of samples.

### Creating a Fair Model

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

data = pd.concat([balanced_kingdom1_data, balanced_kingdom2_data, balanced_kingdom3_data])

X = data.drop("healthcare_cost", axis=1)
y = data["healthcare_cost"]

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

fair_model = LinearRegression().fit(X_train, y_train)
```

To create a fair AI model, Alice first concatenates the balanced datasets. She then separates the features (X) and the target variable (y). Making use of the scikit-learn library, Alice splits the combined data into training and testing subsets using the `train_test_split()` method. Lastly, she trains a Linear Regression model on the training data, thereby creating a fair AI model.

### Evaluating the Fair Model's Predictions

```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

y_pred = fair_model.predict(X_test)

mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
```

Alice evaluates her model's fairness by predicting healthcare costs for the test set and calculating the mean squared error (MSE) using scikit-learn's `mean_squared_error()` method. This step ensures that her model's predictions are unbiased and leads to more equitable outcomes.

**In conclusion,** Alice resolves the trippy story by unveiling and addressing biases in AI through the code. The Python code helps her better understand, address, and mitigate biases in the datasets, leading to the creation of a more ethical AI model for healthcare costs in the three kingdoms.
