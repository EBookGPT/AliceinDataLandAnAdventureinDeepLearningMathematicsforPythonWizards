As the effects of the leaf set in, Alice perceives a newfound understanding of mathematical concepts underlying the depths of deep learning. Linear algebra, calculus, and probability theory dance around her, each illustrating their importance to AI.

For instance, linear algebra techniques emerge:

```python
import numpy as np

A = np.array([[10, -20],
              [30, 40]])

B = np.array([[50, 60],
              [70, 80]])

# Matrix addition
C = np.add(A, B)
```

Probability theory unravels before her eyes:

```python
def normalize_probabilities(x):
    return x / np.sum(x)

probabilities = np.array([12, 3, 5])
normalized_probabilities = normalize_probabilities(probabilities)
```

And calculus, the building block of backpropagation, reveals itself:

```python
def sigmoid_derivative(x):
    return x * (1 - x)
```

## Unleashing the Inner AI Wizard

Under the watchful eyes of the Caterpillar and Yann LeCun, Alice draws upon her newfound understanding to weave magic within the realm of AI research.

Together, they explore activation functions, loss functions, and optimization algorithms which Alice combines to construct her very first neural network.

```python
import keras
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
from keras.optimizers import Adam

# Building a sequential model
model = Sequential([
    Dense(16, input_shape=(784,), activation='relu'),
    Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compiling the model
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              optimizer=Adam(lr=0.001),
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Decoding Alice's Code Adventures in DataLand

In the wondrous realm of DataLand, Alice encountered a variety of code snippets as she delved into the mathematical foundations of AI, guided by the wise Caterpillar and esteemed AI researcher Yann LeCun. Let's take a closer look at those code samples and discern their purpose.

## Linear Algebra - Matrix Addition

```python
import numpy as np

A = np.array([[10, -20],
              [30, 40]])
B = np.array([[50, 60],
              [70, 80]])

# Matrix addition
C = np.add(A, B)
```

In this snippet, Alice dabbled in linear algebra, specifically exploring matrix addition. She defined two matrices, `A` and `B`, and used the `numpy` library to add them element-wise, storing the result in `C`.

## Probability Theory - Normalize Probabilities

```python
def normalize_probabilities(x):
    return x / np.sum(x)

probabilities = np.array([12, 3, 5])
normalized_probabilities = normalize_probabilities(probabilities)
```

Here, Alice tackled probability theory, diving into the process of normalizing probabilities. She wrote a function, `normalize_probabilities`, that accepts an array of probability values, `x`, and divides them by their sum, effectively normalizing the probabilities to ensure they sum to 1.

## Calculus - Sigmoid Derivative

```python
def sigmoid_derivative(x):
    return x * (1 - x)
```

Alice then explored calculus, focusing on the derivative of the sigmoid function. The derivative is essential for backpropagation in neural networks, allowing her to update the weights efficiently. The `sigmoid_derivative` function she created simply calculates the sigmoid function's derivative given an input `x`.

## Neural Network Construction using Keras

```python
import keras
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
from keras.optimizers import Adam

# Building a sequential model
model = Sequential([
    Dense(16, input_shape=(784,), activation='relu'),
    Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compiling the model
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              optimizer=Adam(lr=0.001),
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```

Finally, leveraging her understanding of deep learning concepts, Alice constructed a simple feedforward neural network using the Keras library. She built a `Sequential` model composed of three `Dense` layers, in which the first two used the ReLU activation function and the last one employed the Softmax activation. After defining the architecture, Alice compiled the model with a categorical cross-entropy loss function, an Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001, and tracked the accuracy metric.

With these code snippets in hand, Alice now possesses the foundational knowledge to tackle algorithms, mathematics, and AI wizardry deep within the heart of DataLand.
