# Chapter 35: Scaling the Looking-Glass Wall: Strategies for Parallel and Distributed Computing

_Alice_, with keen curiosity after her latest encounter in the last chapter, began to notice the increase in complexity and the need for focus. "There must be a more efficient way to explore DataLand," she muttered to herself. With her typical adventurous spirit, she could not resist heading towards the mysterious *Looking-Glass Wall*.

In this chapter, we will delve into the realm of _Parallel_ and _Distributed Computing_. Alice, eager to gain more knowledge and power, teams up with the legendary computer scientist, Grace Hopper, to scale the wall and accelerate her decent into DataLand.

Let's embark on this enthralling quest alongside Alice and explore:

1. *__Strategies for Parallel Computing__*
2. *__Efficient techniques for Distributed Computing__*
3. *__Harnessing Parallelism in Python__*
4. *__Managing resources using Networking and Threading__*

> _"The wonderful thing about parallel and distributed computing is that you can do so much with it! And Alice's adventures will never be the same,"_ says Grace Hopper, a talented mathematician and computer scientist who admired interesting computational problems.

### Section 35.1: Strategies for Parallel Computing

_"Tasks are like buttons on a coat, while Threads are the coat-threads that hold them together"_ — Grace Hopper

As Grace Hopper explained to Alice, there are several ways to approach parallel computing, including:

* _Data parallelism_
* _Task parallelism_
* _Pipelining_
* _Array processing_

Grace emphasized that they should identify the best method for their needs, given that each approach has its strengths and weaknesses. While Alice paid close attention to her wise companion, she couldn't help but chuckle at Grace's button analogy.

```python
import numpy as np
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

def square(x):
    return x**2

data = np.arange(1, 11)
with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
    results = executor.map(square, data)
    
print(list(results))
```

### Section 35.2: Efficient techniques for Distributed Computing

> _"Distributed computing is like the pages in a book, spread evenly so each reader can decipher them clearly."_ — Alice

Having learned the importance of parallel computing, Alice and Grace turned their attention to mastering the art of distributed computing. With the RabbitMQ messaging system, they activated Python's `multi-worker` architecture, and Hadoop's MapReduce rose like a bright star on the horizon.

```python
from multiprocessing.pool import ThreadPool

def word_count(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        text = f.read()
    words = text.split()
    return len(words)

file_paths = [
    'text1.txt',
    'text2.txt',
    'text3.txt',
]

with ThreadPool(processes=3) as pool:
    counts = pool.map(word_count, file_paths)

total_words = sum(counts)
print(f"Total words: {total_words}")
```

### Section 35.3: Harnessing Parallelism in Python

As their insightful journey progressed, Alice and Grace discovered ways to maximize parallelism in Python. Grace introduced her eager student to the wonders of the following libraries and architectures:

* *Thread-based* parallelism with `threading` and `concurrent.futures`
* *Process-based* parallelism with `multiprocessing` and `joblib`

Alice couldn't believe her luck! With these tremendous tools at her disposal, the Looking-Glass Wall seemed extraordinarily conquerable.

### Section 35.4: Managing resources using Networking and Threading

_“It’s not easy scaling this tall wall, but with the right tools in hand, it becomes a cinch!”_ — Grace Hopper

Grace and Alice reached the final part of their adventure in parallel and distributed computing. Employing _Asynchronous I/O_, they created nonblocking network servers and clients. Alice learned about _Threads_, _Sockets_, and _Requests_, which provided the foundations for living harmoniously in DataLand.

```python
import asyncio
import aiohttp

async def fetch(session, url):
    async with session.get(url) as response:
        return await response.text()

async def main():
    urls = [
        'http://website1.com',
        'http://website2.com',
    ]
    
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        tasks = [asyncio.ensure_future(fetch(session, url)) for url in urls]
        contents = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
        
        for content in contents:
            print(content)
            
await main()
```

With the help of Grace Hopper, Alice learned the secrets of parallel and distributed computing, opening the door to a realm of endless possibilities in DataLand. Together, they pushed the limits of time and space, making every moment matter and scaling the daunting Looking-Glass Wall.

_Stay tuned for Chapter 36, where Alice meets an enigmatic figure who adds a new dimension to her understanding of Deep Learning Mathematics for Python Wizards._

# Explaining the Code: Alice in DataLand - Scaling the Looking-Glass Wall

This fantastic journey of Alice and Grace Hopper involves four code snippets that serve as powerful guiding lights, teaching the art of parallel and distributed computing.

## Section 35.1: Unraveling the Threads

In this section, Alice and Grace embark on their adventure with *__parallel computing__*. They use the `concurrent.futures` library for thread-based concurrent execution.

```python
import concurrent.futures

def parallel_mystery(x):
    return x * 2

values = range(1,6)
with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
    results = list(executor.map(parallel_mystery, values))
```

**Explanation:**
1. The `import concurrent.futures` statement brings in the library.
2. A simple function named `parallel_mystery` is defined that multiplies its input by 2.
3. A list of values ranging from 1 to 5 is created.
4. A `ThreadPoolExecutor` is created using a `with` block, ensuring that the pool is correctly released after the block execution. `executor.map` applies the `parallel_mystery` function to each value in the list concurrently. The results are then collected in the `results` list.

## Section 35.2: Revolutions in Distributed Computing

Alice and Grace delve deeper into the world of *__distributed computing__*. They harness the power of the `multiprocessing` library to execute tasks across multiple processors.

```python
from multiprocessing import Pool

def distributed_magic(word):
    return len(word.split())

text_data = ["Once", "upon", "a", "time", "in", "DataLand"]

with Pool() as pool:
    results = pool.map(distributed_magic, text_data)
```

**Explanation:**
1. The `from multiprocessing import Pool` statement imports the `Pool` class.
2. A function called `distributed_magic` is defined that calculates the count of words in a given text.
3. A list containing several words is created.
4. A `Pool` object is used to distribute tasks among multiple processors. It maps the `distributed_magic` function to each word in the list. The results are collected and stored.

## Section 35.3: Python Spells Unleashed

Alice and Grace bring to light some powerful *__Python libraries__* for parallel and distributed processing. They utilize the `joblib` library to scale their magical spells.

```python
import joblib

def spell_of_multiplication(x):
    return x * x

numbers = range(6, 11)
results = joblib.Parallel(n_jobs=-1)(joblib.delayed(spell_of_multiplication)(i) for i in numbers)
```

**Explanation:**
1. The `import joblib` statement enables the joblib library.
2. A function named `spell_of_multiplication` is defined to calculate the square of a number.
3. A range of numbers from 6 to 10 is created.
4. `joblib.Parallel` initiates parallel processing with the `n_jobs=-1` flag, indicating that it should use all available processors. `joblib.delayed` marks the function to be called in parallel. A comprehension loop supplies input arguments for each call. This comprehends the results into a single list.

## Section 35.4: Building Networks with AsyncIO

Finally, Alice and Grace utilize the powerful `asyncio` library to build a network of servers and clients and scale the *__Looking-Glass Wall__*.

```python
import asyncio

async def miracle_fetch(url):
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.get(url) as response:
            return await response.text()

urls = ["http://example1.com", "http://example2.com"]
tasks = [asyncio.ensure_future(miracle_fetch(url)) for url in urls]
puzzle_solution = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
```

**Explanation:**
1. `import asyncio` brings in the asyncio library.
2. A coroutine named `miracle_fetch` is declared using `async def`. It accepts a URL as input and returns the fetched content.
3. Two example URLs are provided in a list.
4. A list of tasks is created using `asyncio.ensure_future` and `miracle_fetch` for each URL in the list.
5. `asyncio.gather` collects the results of all tasks and awaits their completion. The final content from the websites is stored in `puzzle_solution`.

These code snippets have helped Alice become a Python Wizard in DataLand and have taught her valuable insights into parallel and distributed computing. Now she's well-equipped to face any computational challenge that comes her way!
