# Chapter 24: Logical Conundrums with the White Knight: Rule-based Systems and Expert Systems

In this chapter, Alice stumbles upon the mysterious and enigmatic world of Rule-based Systems and Expert Systems. Traveling with the inimitable White Knight, she will learn to tackle logical conundrums, the secrets behind the magical beings that possess vast knowledge and complex reasoning capabilities, and harness the power of Python to create her very own virtual expert.

Far behind her, the Card Kingdom now lies,  
And through a foggy, misty land of logic and rules, she strides.  
Aided by the noble White Knight, a mentor and a guide  
Together, they traverse DataLand, side by side.  

## Rule-based Systems Unmasked

In the twisting, turning lanes of DataLand, Alice discovered rule-based systems. These logical wyrms, ever elusive, craft rules, encode facts and work their art on matching and inferring. With code that's logical, deductive and magical, they provide a foundation that serves others before them.

```python
class RuleSystem:
    def __init__(self, rules = None):
        self.rules = rules or []
    
    def add_rule(self, rule):
        self.rules.append(rule)

criteria = lambda f: f["day"] == "Saturday" and f["weather"] == "sunny"
action = lambda f: f["activity"] = "picnic"

rule_system = RuleSystem()
rule_system.add_rule((criteria, action))
```

As she ventured deeper into this world, Alice swiftly realized that the power of rule-based systems could be harnessed to create more advanced constructs. These constructs, she learned, were called "Expert Systems."

## An Introduction to Expert Systems

Armed with excitement and curiosity, Alice moved forward with the White Knight to uncover the truth about expert systems. Here, in a network of interconnected rules, lied the incomprehensible knowledge of experts, coded into logical statements that would eclipse the brightest mind.

Expert systems are a class of AI systems that resemble human expertise by inferring conclusions from given data. They use the sophisticated art of deciding, sometimes conjuring solutions, and impressing the common folk with marvelous predictions.

```python
class ExpertSystem(RuleSystem):
    def __init__(self, rules=None, facts=None):
        super().__init__(rules)
        self.facts = facts or {}
    
    def fire_rules(self):
        for criteria, action in self.rules:
            if criteria(self.facts):
                action(self.facts)

facts = {"day": "Saturday", "weather": "sunny"}

expert_system = ExpertSystem([criteria, action], facts)
expert_system.fire_rules()
```

By the end of this grand chapter, Alice would not only have the knowledge of the ancients, but she would possess the oracle's clarity. With the White Knight by her side, a path through the foggy mist shall be made clear. The World of Rule-based and Expert Systems awaits, so onward with great cheer!
# The Tale of Logical Conundrums with the White Knight

Alice found herself standing on the edge of an enchanted forest, eyeing the unfamiliar scenery with an eager sense of anticipation. The trees swayed with a mixture of curiosity and caution, gossiping about the stranger in their abode.

As she wandered through the dense foliage, a white knight emerged, astride his noble steed. His demeanor was wise, captivating Alice's attention instantly. "Welcome, Alice! We've been expecting you," he said with a warm smile. "DataLand has been eagerly waiting for your arrival."

"Where am I?" inquired Alice, intrigued by the new adventure that awaited her.

"You are in the magical realm of Rule-based Systems and Expert Systems," he replied, pausing to let the words settle in her mind. "Here, we communicate with nature and creatures alike using rules, logic, and powerful enchanted machinery. Come, let us show you!"

## The Rule of the Talking Trees

Strolling hand in hand, Alice and the White Knight began their journey. The woods were abuzz with activity, the rustle of leaves and chattering creatures as the wind carried their secrets through the trees.

The White Knight stopped, turning to Alice. "Watch closely, young Alice, as I communicate with the trees." With a flourish, he brandished his wand and wrote the following incantation in the air:

```python
class RuleSystem:
    def __init__(self, rules=None):
        self.rules = rules or []

    def add_rule(self, rule):
        self.rules.append(rule)

criteria_talking = lambda f: f["creature"] == "tree" and f["location"] == "magical_forest"
action_talking = lambda f: f["communication"] = "mind_speech"

rule_system = RuleSystem()
rule_system.add_rule((criteria_talking, action_talking))
```

The trees appeared to bow to the knight reverently, acknowledging their role. And then, to Alice's amazement, the trees began to share their thoughts with her directly, their consciousness merging with hers.

## Expert Systems and the River of Knowledge

Still in awe, Alice and the White Knight continued their journey, eventually reaching a grand river. The water shimmered with knowledge and understanding, defying the grasp of those who sought to claim it.

The White Knight gestured towards the river. "This, Alice, is the River of Knowledge, where expert systems lend their wisdom to those who prove their worth." He raised his wand once more, connecting the ancient energy of the enchanted land with the expert system's vast intellect.

```python
class ExpertSystem(RuleSystem):
    def __init__(self, rules=None, facts=None):
        super().__init__(rules)
        self.facts = facts or {}

    def fire_rules(self):
        for criteria, action in self.rules:
            if criteria(self.facts):
                action(self.facts)

facts = {"creature": "tree", "location": "magical_forest"}

expert_system = ExpertSystem([criteria_talking, action_talking], facts)
expert_system.fire_rules()
```

As the White Knight cast the spell, Alice felt her mind expand, her understanding of the world around her growing in profound leaps and bounds. A newfound mastery of logic and rule-based systems coursed through her veins, providing her with the ability to tackle any conundrum with ease.

Embracing her newfound powers, Alice and the White Knight ventured forth, hand in hand, to unravel the remaining mysteries within the enigmatic realm of DataLand. With expert systems by her side, there was no challenge that couldn't be solved and no answer that couldn't be found.
# Code Explanation: Unraveling the Logic of the Trippy Adventure

In the fantastical journey of Alice in DataLand, our protagonist encounters the mystical world of Rule-based Systems and Expert Systems. These powerful constructs were weaved into the tale and played a key role in resolving the story. Let us delve into the code behind the magic and discover how it all fell into place.

## Rule-based Systems: Talking Trees

The White Knight uses a rule-based system to communicate with the talking trees, which played a significant part in showcasing the power of rules and logic in DataLand.

```python
class RuleSystem:
    def __init__(self, rules=None):
        self.rules = rules or []

    def add_rule(self, rule):
        self.rules.append(rule)
```

The `RuleSystem` class laid the groundwork for the communication with the trees by providing a way to store rules and add new rules.

```python
criteria_talking = lambda f: f["creature"] == "tree" and f["location"] == "magical_forest"
action_talking = lambda f: f["communication"] = "mind_speech"
```

Two lambda functions, `criteria_talking` and `action_talking`, defined the conditions under which trees could communicate telepathically.

- `criteria_talking` checks if the specified creature is a tree in a magical forest.
- `action_talking` sets the communication mode to mind-speech if the criteria are met.

```python
rule_system = RuleSystem()
rule_system.add_rule((criteria_talking, action_talking))
```

An instance of the `RuleSystem` class is created, and the talking tree rule is added, represented as a tuple of `(criteria_talking, action_talking)`.

## Expert Systems: The River of Knowledge

Alice, with the guidance of the White Knight, gains incredible knowledge after forging a connection with the Expert System that governs the River of Knowledge.

```python
class ExpertSystem(RuleSystem):
    def __init__(self, rules=None, facts=None):
        super().__init__(rules)
        self.facts = facts or {}

    def fire_rules(self):
        for criteria, action in self.rules:
            if criteria(self.facts):
                action(self.facts)
```

The `ExpertSystem` class derives from the `RuleSystem` class and enhances it with the ability to maintain facts and fire rules.

- The `facts` dictionary stores key-value pairs that represent various attributes.
- The `fire_rules()` method iterates through all the rules and checks their respective criteria against the facts. If the criteria are met, the appropriate action is executed.

```python
facts = {"creature": "tree", "location": "magical_forest"}

expert_system = ExpertSystem([criteria_talking, action_talking], facts)
expert_system.fire_rules()
```

An `ExpertSystem` instance is created with the same talking tree rule as the `RuleSystem`. The `facts` dictionary correctly defines a tree in a magical forest. The `fire_rules()` method checks the rules, and since the criteria match the facts, the action `mind_speech` is set as the communication mode, allowing Alice to converse with the trees.

Through the magical powers of rule-based systems and expert systems, Alice learns to resolve challenges and wield logic in the mystical realm of DataLand.
