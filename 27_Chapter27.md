# Our text data, ready to be analyzed and classified
texts = [...]  # List of sentences
sentiments = [...]  # List of corresponding sentiments

# Tokenizing and encoding our text data
tokenizer = Tokenizer(num_words=10000, oov_token='<OOV>')
tokenizer.fit_on_texts(texts)
sequences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(texts)
padded_sequences = pad_sequences(sequences, padding='post')

# Building the model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Embedding(10000, 64, input_length=50),
    tf.keras.layers.Bidirectional(tf.keras.layers.LSTM(32)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(16, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile and train the model
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.summary()

history = model.fit(padded_sequences, sentiments, epochs=5, validation_split=0.1)
```

# Chapter 27: Jabberwocky! Sentiment Analysis and Text Classification

_**Featuring special guest, Ada Lovelace**_

## An Enchanted Encounter in DataLand

As Alice journeyed through the realm of DataLand, bewildered by its mathematical charms and peculiarities, she stumbled upon a distinctive figure standing beside an ancient loom. Clad in Victorian attire and possessing an air of intellect, Ada Lovelace met Alice with a polite curtsy.

"Good day, dear Alice. Have you found your way into the world of Sentiment Analysis and Text Classification?" Ada queried.

Alice, puzzled by the appearance of Ada Lovelace, responded shyly, "Yes, I have been exploring the magical domain of DataLand. Each step reveals more intriguing concepts and algorithms. But I must confess, I am still grappling with the complexities of Sentiment Analysis and Text Classification."

"Fear not, dear Alice," Ada reassured her. "Together, we shall decipher the intricacies of these tasks and venture deeper into the world of words and sentiments."

And so, the two embarked on a whimsical quest to discover the secrets hidden within the Jabberwocky!

## The Jabberwocky's Sentiment Analysis Challenge

In the heart of DataLand, they came face-to-face with the formidable Jabberwocky, a mythical beast famed for its enigmatic language. Ada, in her wisdom, chose to challenge the beast with a task to determine the sentiment of its own text.

"Jabberwocky," Ada declared, "we beseech you to classify the sentiment of your bewildering words using the mystical powers of deep learning mathematics."

The Jabberwocky, enthralled by the prospect, agreed to the challenge, and Alice and Ada began instructing the creature in the art of Sentiment Analysis and Text Classification.

## A Mathematical Dance With Word Weights and Connectionist Models

Alice and Ada taught the Jabberwocky the power of Neural Networks, diving into the underlying mathematics that turns words into numbers called _embedding vectors_, allowing emotions to be unraveled and understood.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Creating an embedding matrix
embedding_matrix = np.random.rand(10000, 64)
embedded_word<ipython-input-1-e189d814f369>s = pd.DataFrame(embedding_matrix, columns=[f'dim_{i}' for i in range(1, 65)])
```

With an enchanted measure of connectionist flair, they introduced the Jabberwocky to the _Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)_ and _Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)_ cells to master the art of sentiment analysis.

```python
# Defining a simple LSTM model
class SimpleLSTM(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim, rnn_units):
        super().__init__(self)
        self.embedding = tf.keras.layers.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
        self.lstm = tf.keras.layers.LSTM(rnn_units, return_sequences=True, recurrent_initializer='glorot_uniform')
        self.dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(vocab_size)

    def call(self, x):
        x = self.embedding(x)
        x = self.lstm(x)
        x = self.dense(x)
        return x

model = SimpleLSTM(vocab_size=10000, embedding_dim=64, rnn_units=128)
```

As the Jabberwocky diligently practiced these arcane techniques, it gleaned insight into how the Tensor flowed and the Keras bloomed, transforming its words into sentiment-laden probabilities.

```python
# Compile and train the model
model.compile(loss=tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy(from_logits=True), optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(), metrics=['accuracy'])
history = model.fit(padded_sequences, sentiments, epochs=10, validation_split=0.2, batch_size=32)
```

## And Lo! The Sentiment Revealed

With newfound proficiency in Sentiment Analysis and Text Classification, the Jabberwocky began to recognize the sentiments concealed beneath its poetic verse. Elation! Surprise! Bewilderment! The creature's world was now abloom with an emotional rainbow.

As the Jabberwocky unraveled its feelings, Alice and Ada Lovelace smiled victoriously. They had successfully navigated the enchanting world of DataLand and imparted the mathematical secrets of Sentiment Analysis and Text Classification.

Their journey complete, Alice and Ada strolled away hand-in-hand, seeking out the next grand adventure weaving through the intricate tapestry of DataLand.
# Decoding the Sentiment Analysis and Text Classification Code

In the mystical journey of Alice and Ada Lovelace through DataLand, several techniques and code snippets were employed to navigate the enigmatic realm of Sentiment Analysis and Text Classification. Let us delve into the code and unearth the secrets that were unveiled.

## 1. Creating the Embedding Matrix

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Creating an embedding matrix
embedding_matrix = np.random.rand(10000, 64)
embedded_words = pd.DataFrame(embedding_matrix, columns=[f'dim_{i}' for i in range(1, 65)])
```

In this code snippet, Alice and Ada created a sample _embedding matrix_ to demonstrate the power of converting words into numbers. This matrix consists of random values for the demonstration, but in practice, it is populated with meaningful _embedding vectors_ that represent the unique characteristics and relationships between words.

## 2. Defining a Simple LSTM Model

```python
# Defining a simple LSTM model
class SimpleLSTM(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim, rnn_units):
        super().__init__(self)
        self.embedding = tf.keras.layers.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
        self.lstm = tf.keras.layers.LSTM(rnn_units, return_sequences=True, recurrent_initializer='glorot_uniform')
        self.dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(vocab_size)

    def call(self, x):
        x = self.embedding(x)
        x = self.lstm(x)
        x = self.dense(x)
        return x

model = SimpleLSTM(vocab_size=10000, embedding_dim=64, rnn_units=128)
```

In this segment, Alice and Ada defined a simple LSTM model as a class in Python. The model comprises three layers:

1. **Embedding Layer:** This layer converts the input words into _embedding vectors_.
2. **LSTM Layer:** The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layer is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that can learn and maintain information over long sequences. It is used for capturing the structure and meaning within the text.
3. **Dense Layer:** The Dense layer generates the output as a probability distribution over the vocabulary size.

## 3. Compiling and Training the Model

```python
# Compile and train the model
model.compile(loss=tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy(from_logits=True), optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(), metrics=['accuracy'])
history = model.fit(padded_sequences, sentiments, epochs=10, validation_split=0.2, batch_size=32)
```

After defining the LSTM model, Alice and Ada compiled it, specifying the loss function, optimizer, and evaluation metric. In this instance, they chose:

1. **Loss Function:** Binary Cross-Entropy loss, which is well-suited for binary classification tasks like sentiment analysis.
2. **Optimizer:** The Adam optimizer, an adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm that has demonstrated efficiency and robustness in training machine learning models.
3. **Evaluation Metric:** Accuracy, which measures the proportion of correct sentiment classifications out of the total predictions.

They then proceeded to train the model on the padded sequences and their corresponding sentiments for a predefined number of epochs while setting aside a portion of the data for validation.

By understanding and applying these code snippets, learners follow in the footsteps of Alice and Ada Lovelace, unveiling the enchanting realm of Sentiment Analysis and Text Classification in DataLand.
